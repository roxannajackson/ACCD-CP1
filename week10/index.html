            <h1>Roxanna's Week 10 P5js Homework</h1>
            <p><b>Planetary Orbit and Starfield</b><br>
            For this assignment, I had a really great time trying to figure how to tie in the oscillation techiniques we learned during class. Based on the prompt you provided I wanted to explore the idea of planets orbiting a sun for the repeated motion and a comet passing through periodically for the predetermined interval.<Br><br>

            <iframe 
                src="https://editor.p5js.org/ontherox/full/yZz9xvJKG"
                width="60%"

                style="border: none;">
            </iframe>
            <br><br>
            
            Since I was familiar with the rotation techniques that were shown during the rotating oscillation exercise, I wanted to apply those ideas but with a planetary orbit. To start off I created a sun-like object in the center and added three planets orbiting the sun. <Br><br>

            <br><br>

            After playing around with the code a bit more, I added another planet in a different color, size, and speed for variety. With the other planets already there, I also made asjustments to their speed while I was iterating just to see what the outcomes would be. For me personally, sometimes the best way to learn to read and edit code is making adjustments to everything.  <br><br>

            With the animated oscillation set, I wanted to add more to scene to give it some depth. To achieve this I added a Perlin noise affect in the form of random particles. With some adjustments and edits, it gives off the look and effect of stars or a galaxy. In an effort to make it not appear static, I added a slight movement or pulse.<br><br>

            In an effort to add something that would appear in a predetermined interval, I added a comet that would pass through every 5 seconds.<br><br>

            At this time the sun in the center didn't appear as bright or prominent as I pictured, so I decided to add several glowing layers to give it a more radiant look and feel. I added several rings that lose opacity the more they go out.<br><br>
